#Description
This program is used by Five Star Property Management to train their new hires. I designed this quiz so that the user will follow the questions of the quiz with the rental 
software that the company uses. The user will follow the quetions, search the rental software, and answer the question. They will be given a score and that score is 
recorded so that the manager of that new employee can guage where that employee is at in their training knowledge. 

#Usage
This program is used by Five Star Property Management in Pocatello, ID. It is used for training purposes so that the management team can test their new employees knowledge.
